# GeoTag Application - Machine Learning Path

## Description

Inovative application for SMEs with traceability system to improve product quality so user can learn more about SMEs product with a single scan. Our idea is to provide recommendations for similar product to user after scanning QR Code of a certain product. We also provide product stock prediction for SMEs so they can predict how many stock needed to improve supply chain management.

## Recommendation System

A recommendation system is a type of software or algorithm that provides suggestions or recommendations to users. These suggestions are typically based on the user's preferences, behavior, or historical data. Recommendation systems are widely used in various applications, such as e-commerce platforms, streaming services, social media, and more.

On this application we use content-based filtering approach which recommends products based on the features of the products and the preferences of the user.

## Time Series

A time series is a sequence of data points collected or recorded at successive points in time. Time series data is ordered chronologically, and it is often used to analyze trends, patterns, and behaviors over time. Time series analysis involves methods and techniques to understand and model the temporal structure of the data.

To predict future values of product stock based on historical observations, this involves forecasting task. We also use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) technique to train the model so that it can capture and remember information over longer sequences.
